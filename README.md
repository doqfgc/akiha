# Projekt Akiha, the new Melee Toolbox
The Melee Toolbox is a solution for starting and keeping up to date applications related to modifying code and files in Super Smash Bros. Melee. The Melee Toolbox itself cannot modify files themselves, but can download, launch, and update applications that can.

Projekt Akiha projects two variations of the Melee Toolbox:
* Melee Toolbox 4.5: A GUI-based launcher. Recommended for most users. Does not include command-line exclusive applications like gcrc and MeleeHPS. This is now [Projekt Shiki](http://github.com/doqtorkirby/shiki)
* Melee Toolbox Extended 4.5: A command-based launcher. Includes support for all applications. Normally synonymous with versions of Melee Toolbox before 4.0.
